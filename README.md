# Data-Structure

Data structure is a way of organizing the data in computer so we can use efficiencly.

we can classified data structure in two parts:-
1) Primitive 
2) 2) Non-Primitive

1) Primitive: This type of data structure directly operate on machine instruction. This are predefined.
A) Integer
B) Float
C) Character
D) Pointer

2) Non-primitive: This type of DS derived from primitive DS. They are not directly operate upon machine.
We can classfied Non-primitive DS into two categories:
1) Linear 
          1) Array
          2) Stack
          3) Queue
          4) Linked List
2) Non-linear
          1) Tree
          2) Graph
